# Intro and Note

This is a backend of a minimal minimal viable benchmark (MMVB) designed and developed by the members of the sub-group (topic group) “Symptom assessment”, which is the part of the ITU focus group “Artificial Intelligence for Health”. The minimal minimal viable benchmark is a prototype and does not reflect in any possible way real methods, techniques, approaches, etc. that the members (including commercial companies) use in their products.

As mentioned on [the focus group website](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx): “The ITU/WHO Focus Group on artificial intelligence for health (FG-AI4H) works in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish a standardized assessment framework for the evaluation of AI-based methods for health, diagnosis, triage or treatment decisions. Participation in the FG-AI4H is free of charge and open to all.”

Note that currently this repo has both a backend implementation and also a previous frontend implementation. The latest frontend version has been implemented and is located in this repo: https://github.com/FG-AI4H-TG-Symptom/fgai4h-tg-symptom-benchmarking-frontend



# How to run

```python
mkvirtualenv your-name-for-a-python-virtual-environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 run_all.py
```
and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5005/ for the main web interface.

You also can access individual end-points:
* Case generator: http://127.0.0.1:5001/case-generator/v1/ui/
* Toy AI implementations: http://127.0.0.1:5002/toy-ai/v1/ui/
* Evaluator of AI results against cases: http://127.0.0.1:5003/evaluator/v1/ui/
* Metric calculators: http://127.0.0.1:5004/metric-calculator/v1/ui/

API specification can be found in `/swagger/` folder.

## Running on MacOS 10.13 High Sierra and beyond

You might experience an exception like
```
... may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
```

To avoid it, you could consider modifying the environment before running the benchmark scripts as follows (at your own risk):
```
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```

More info can be found here by searching the Internet for `python and OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY`. Some related links:

# Adding your own AI implementation

To add your own AI implementation to the MMVB, you need to:
1. Decide what port to use (e.g. from 5006 inclusive).
2. Either have it in a separate repo or add it to this repo via a pull request.
3. If you are adding it to this repo, you can make it starting automatically by modifying `/run_all.py`.
4. Add your implementation into the dictionary `AI_TYPES_TO_LOCATIONS` in `/evaluator/api.py`, where the key is a name of your choice and the value is the URL to your implementation's `solve-case` method.


# Adding new metrics

You can add new metrics by modifying `/metric_calculator/api.py`:
1. You need to modify `SUPPORTED_METRICS` to add a new metric.
2. You need to implement it, currently in method `calculate_metrics`.

Once a metric is added, you need to update tests in `/tests/test_metric_calculator.py`.


# Tests

There are several tests included to verify the functionality of the
different components of the MMVB. To set up your environment for testing,
activate your virtual environment and run:
```
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```
To run the tests, run:
```
pytest
```
